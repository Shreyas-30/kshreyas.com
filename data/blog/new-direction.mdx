# Why I want to start writing

I first got on the Internet in 2011-12 when I was in 7th standard and I still remember those early days when
the dial-up broadband connection would get interrupted every time there was a call on the landline and I had
to wait for the call to get over to connect again. It would take 10-15 mins for a short 5 min YouTube video
to load in 240p. I used to spend hours sitting at the computer surfing websites, personal blogs, games and videos
soaking up as much as I could.

Since childhood I was awed by the amazing documentaries and science shows on National Geographic and Discovery channel
and when the Internet came I started looking up the things I saw on these shows, digging into new topics everyday.
It was something like - I see or read about topic and I kept learning all I could get about it and until I had found
the best quality content and people on that topic - then the cycle for another topic began.
I had found out about MITOCW and tried my hands on a CS class teaching java with a game character Karel the Robot.
On YouTube I vividly remember I had created notes from the Make presents and Collin’s Lab series which introduced
electronic components, instruments and explained their inner workings which was very fascinating. This was the first
time I was studying something all on my own that was no where near the school syllabus.
Throughout my school life I was lucky to have multiple RC cars and helicopters, and within a few months after
I used to get them I had disassembled most of them to find out how these things work. Searching around these toys
I was introduced to the world of RC and Lego, the sites I used to read and videos of people building there own RC cars,
planes, helicopters, model towns with loads of moving things in RC fairs and LEGO land would feel completely out of this world.

Around the time when I got in 8th standard I had started following TechnoBuffalo, DetriotBorg, CNET, MKBHD and some more early
tech YouTube channels. We had a small Song digital camera which I used to shoot photos of interesting things in our garden and
around the house. I had learnt how to handle the camera I started delving in photography and film making.
Then around 2013 along with my cousins we tried starting up a Tech blogs and YouTube channel called GETin.
This was my first foray into creating content for the internet. Although it only lasted till the time I completed my 10th standard
I had enjoyed every bit of that process that went behind creating our site and channel, right from creating the blogs,
designing our logo, banners, researching around the topics, writing scripts, shooting and editing our videos
and everything in between.

History, wars, learning how nations and civilianisation has evolved was also something I read and still have more to read about.
Not just in the digital world of internet but also in the physical world everything I saw around me I have always had the
curiosity to learn about it and the people who are involved with it. Always following around any servicemen who came for
electrical works, carpentry/woodworking, plumbing or any construction that used to take place in the area. I was there watching,
listening and observing how human - nature interactions as they took place.

All the things I mentioned above is just scratching the surface. There are lots of more detail in these subjects,
more interesting topics and corners of the internet that I have explored and that are stored up in my brain all these years,
or kept saved as bookmarks, reading lists, downloads, playlists, subscriptions, etc.
This hunger to learn how the world around us works and understand what life is all about has been a constant even today,
but in those early days it felt like I had unlimited time and mental bandwidth for learning, but over the past few years as
I have started working a full time job and the new forms of content and the distractions have kept growing creating an
information overload. And it is critically important to become better at deciding what to consume and be thorough well
read about it. Now to keep exploring the world at the same pace, building and keeping my mental catalogue/memex organised
I think writing down the interesting things I have found and new topics that I explore and experience would be the best thing to do. That would be help me to look back as notes and browse through them again whenever I want.

So as I start to write down my learning’s, experiences and interesting people and thoughts I find on the internet and
around me I would be sharing all of it for the world here on this site.

I welcome you all to my space on the Internet and I hope you enjoy reading the blogs.
If you are someone who knows me and you would like to learn something you think I know about, feel free to get in touch I will definitely try to share whatever I know on that topic through this blog.
